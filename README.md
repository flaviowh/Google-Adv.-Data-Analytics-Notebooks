# Google-Adv.-Data-Analytics-Notebooks
Some highlights from the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional course

These are the most important points covered during the 7 courses in this certificate (according to me).
The purpose of this repository of notebooks is to document my learning and also for reference. This is by
no means all the material covered. There are other documents useful for reference but I chose to share only
the notebooks. I already had some previous knowledge of ML, as you can check on my ML repo, and the books in the notes. 
But this course gave me more confidence in using explainable models and a stronger grasp of the foundations of DS
and the importance of other skills besides technical.

For claritication, the courses that comprise the certificate are:

### Foundations of Data Science
Here we are introduced to the concept of data analysis, the difference between the roles in the data field, and what to expect from the course. Throughout this and all the courses, there are many valuable career insights given by Google employees of diverse fields related to data.

### Get Started with Python

This is an introduction to the Python language and its scientific libraries. I sped through it since I was already familiar with the language and many libraries, but there was still a thing or two to learn.

### Go Beyond the Numbers: Translate Data into Insights

A very valuable material to learn how to think beyond models and see the patterns in data from the first steps of exploratory analysis, and the importance of effective communication to the stakeholders.

### The Power of Statistics

A run through of basic statistics taught in most undergraduate courses, but with the simplicity of Python.

### Regression Analysis: Simplify Complex Data Relationships

This is a very in-depth exploration of regression, linear and logistic. I was already familiar with LinearRegression library from scikit-learn but this introduced to me the amazing OLS lib and the concept of presumptions for linearity in a way that stuck more with me than what I had learned from the books (see notes).

### The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning

Here we got our hands on models I was already familiar with, mostly of the supervised learning type, such as trees, random forests, xgboost, naive bayes. And unsepervised clustering models. I learned more about how to chose these models for each specific task and how to tune them properly. I only regret the course not covering neural networks, wich I learned a little about from books, but it makes sense since almost all the models taught are explainable, and also perform very reliably and even better than a black-box NN in many situations.

### Google Advanced Data Analytics Capstone

The end of the course challenge. Pretty underwhelming considering the previous notebooks to be honest.

### Notes

if you are interested in data science and machine learning and know some Python already, I cannot recommend these two books enough, which should be read in the following order:

**Practical Statistics For Data Scientists**  - O'Reilly-  by Peter Bruce, Andrew Bruce and Peter Gedeck 

**Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems 3rd Edition**  - O'Reilly - by by Aurélien Géron
